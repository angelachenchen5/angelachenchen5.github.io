WHAT IS A SUMMER CHRISTMAS?
</div>

    <div class="whatis">
    
      Unlike most of the Western world, Australians celebrate Christmas at the height of summer. This means that we‚Äôre as far as we can get from the traditional mode of Christmas celebration: no snowmen, no evenings spent cuddled in front of the fire, and no white Christmas morning.Despite this we continue to celebrate Christmas as if we were living in another hemisphere. We like a good Christmas roast, insist on having plastic pine trees decked up with lights, and hang fake holly and mistletoe around our houses. 
      <br>
      <br>

      For first-time visitors from the northern hemisphere, it can be a real shock because it's scorching hot, its laughter and fun, it's family/friends, it's a BBQ, it's beach, it's cricket, it's beer ... lots of ice cold beer and it's singing Christmas carols. Yes we sing White Christmas, Rudolph, Frosty the Snowman, Winter Wonderland, Let It Snow and other stuff that has nothing to do with our Southern Hemisphere climate ... but we sing them with great gusto anyway at the kids event "Carols in the Domain" in Sydney and at the "Myer Music Bowl" in Melbourne which is telecast to all Australians on National TV every Christmas eve.
